## 1. Motivation

There has been a prevailing stereotype about aggressiveness and speed on the roads being characteristics of owners of high-value cars such as BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz. The media in the United States has frequently featured stories about these car models in connection with cases of reckless driving on the roads. For example, The Washington Post and Forbes magazines have published stories related to the driving habits of car owners who invest in high-value cars, perpetuating the myth that these cars are driven at higher speeds and in a more reckless manner on the roads. The question is whether there is any truth in the myth or not.

The purpose of the project is to attempt to answer the question with real-world data. The data from traffic violations committed in the U.S. can be analyzed to see if there is any correlation between high-value vehicles and speed-related violations to see if the myth has any validity to it, or if it greatly distorts the truth.

Due to the large difference in the number of mid-range cars, rather than upscale vehicles, normalizing the data with the total number of vehicles in each make or price category is imperative to the project. The process will eliminate the need to calculate rates of violations in favor of rates of violations per price category because it gives accurate results.

The process ranges from data collection and cleaning to data exploration and visualization, to application of statistics and machine learning algorithms to test hypotheses on vehicles' speed based on price data.

| **Data Cleaning**                   | Filter speeding-related incidents, normalize brand names, remove missing or inconsistent records. |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Study speeding frequency by car make, type, and value tier.                                       |
| **Statistical Analysis**            | Test whether car cost correlates with speeding likelihood.                                        |
| **Machine Learning**                | Build models predicting speeding probability based on brand and contextual features.              |

## 3. Data Sources

### Traffic Violations Dataset (Main)

* **Title:** Traffic Violations – Montgomery County, Maryland (USA)
* **Source:** [Data.gov – Traffic Violations](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations)
* **Size:** ≈ 800 MB (>1 million records)
* **Focused Fields:** `Date Of`, `Time Of`, `Make`, `Violation`, `Charge`, `VehicleType`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Year`
* **Purpose:** Identify speeding incidents and their associated car brands to measure brand-level speeding behavior

### Car Price Dataset (Enrichment)

* **Title:** U.S. Sales Cars Dataset
* **Source:** [Kaggle – US Sales Cars Dataset (2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juanmerinobermejo/us-sales-cars-dataset)
* **Size:** ≈ 200 MB (>400,000 listings)
* **Focused Fields:** `make`, `price`, `model`, `year`
* **Purpose:** Compute average brand-level prices and classify vehicles into **price tiers** (*Budget / Mid / Luxury*)
* **Join Key:** Car brand (`Make`)

### Data Integration Plan

1. **Clean** and standardize brand names in both datasets (e.g., “B.M.W.” → “BMW”).
2. **Aggregate** Kaggle data to obtain average price per brand.
3. **Categorize** brands into three tiers: Budget (< $30 k), Mid ($30–50 k), Luxury (> $50 k).
4. **Merge** tier data with traffic-violation records using `Make`.
5. **Normalize** violation counts by brand frequency (tickets per thousand registered vehicles).
6. **Analyze** speeding frequency and probability across tiers.

*Note:* The price dataset is used as a **static enrichment layer**, not a time-series match. Brand-level price hierarchies remain stable over time, so temporal differences do not affect the validity of this behavioral analysis.

## 4. Analysis Plan

### Step 1 – Data Cleaning

* Select relevant columns only.
* Filter rows with `Violation` containing “SPEED”.
* Drop missing or invalid entries.
* Normalize brand names for consistency.

### Step 2 – EDA

* Count speeding violations per brand.
* Calculate rates of violations per brand or price tier.
* Visualize with:

  * Bar charts (speeding counts per brand)
  * Boxplots (price tier vs speeding rate)
  * Heatmaps (correlations between features)

### Step 3 – Hypothesis Testing

* **H₀:** No relationship between vehicle price tier and speeding frequency.
* **H₁:** Luxury brands have a higher proportion of speeding violations.
* Apply chi-square or ANOVA tests; compute effect size (Cramér’s V).

### Step 4 – Machine Learning

* Build **classification models** (Logistic Regression / Random Forest).
* Predict `is_speeding` using features such as price tier, brand, vehicle type, and time of day.
* Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC.
* Interpret **feature importance**.

### Step 5 – Visualization and Storytelling

* Present key findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

  * Speeding distribution by tier and brand
  * Time-of-day patterns
  * Predictive feature importance
* Summarize results in a clear, evidence-based narrative.

## 6. Expected Deliverables

* Cleaned and merged dataset (`violations_enriched.csv`)
* Jupyter notebooks for EDA, hypothesis testing, and modeling
* Visualizations
* Final report summarizing insights and limitations

## 7. Data Compatibility Justification

The traffic-violation dataset spans multiple years, while the car-price dataset provides a recent snapshot of brand-level vehicle values in the U.S.
Because relative brand prices remain stable across time, these datasets can be combined reliably.
Normalization by brand frequency ensures that results reflect proportional behavior rather than raw totals, providing a fair cross-brand comparison.

## Summary

**Main Dataset:** Traffic Violations (Maryland – Data.gov)
**Enrichment Dataset:** US Sales Cars Dataset (Kaggle)
**Objective:** Determine whether higher-priced vehicle brands are more frequently involved in speeding violations after normalization for brand frequency.
**Outcome:** Apply data-science methods to test a widely held social perception with real, normalized data.
