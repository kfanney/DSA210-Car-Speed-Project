## 1Ô∏è. Motivation

There‚Äôs a long-held belief that luxury-car drivers are more aggressive on the road ‚Äî that BMWs, Audis, and Mercedes-Benzs dominate speeding tickets and reckless-driving statistics.
But is that really true, or just a stereotype?

This project investigates the **relationship between vehicle cost and speeding behavior** using large-scale, real-world data from U.S. traffic violations.
By integrating **violation records** with **car price data**, the study aims to reveal whether expensive cars are genuinely more involved in speeding incidents ‚Äî or if that perception is simply social bias.

The project will follow the **entire data-science pipeline** ‚Äî data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine-learning prediction ‚Äî to uncover behavioral insights behind the wheel.

| **Data Cleaning**                   | Filter speeding-related incidents, normalize brand names, remove missing or inconsistent records. |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Study speeding frequency by car make, type, and value tier.                                       |
| **Statistical Analysis**            | Test whether car cost correlates with speeding likelihood.                                        |

## 3Ô∏è. Data Sources

### Traffic Violations Dataset (Main)

* **Title:** Traffic Violations ‚Äì Montgomery County, Maryland (USA)
* **Source:** [Data.gov ‚Äì Traffic Violations](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations)
* **Size:** ‚âà 800 MB (>1 million records)
* **Fields Used:** `Date Of`, `Time Of`, `Make`, `Violation`, `Charge`, `VehicleType`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Year`.
* **Purpose:** Identify speeding incidents and their associated car brands to measure brand-level speeding behavior.

### Car Price Dataset (Enrichment)

* **Title:** U.S. Sales Cars Dataset
* **Source:** [Kaggle ‚Äì US Sales Cars Dataset (2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juanmerinobermejo/us-sales-cars-dataset)
* **Size:** ‚âà 200 MB (>400 k listings)
* **Fields Used:** `make`, `price`, `model`, `year`.
* **Purpose:** Compute average brand-level prices and classify vehicles into **price tiers** (*Budget / Mid / Luxury*).
* **Join Key:** Car brand (`Make`).

### Data Integration Plan

1. **Clean** and standardize brand names in both datasets (e.g., ‚ÄúB.M.W.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúBMW‚Äù).
2. **Aggregate** Kaggle data to obtain average price per brand.
3. **Categorize** brands into three tiers: Budget (< $30 k), Mid ($30‚Äì50 k), Luxury (> $50 k).
4. **Merge** tier data with traffic-violation records using `Make`.
5. **Analyze** speeding frequency and probability across tiers.

*Note:* The price dataset is used as a **static enrichment layer**, not a time-series match. Brand-level price hierarchies remain stable across years, so temporal misalignment does not affect the validity of the behavioral analysis.

## 4Ô∏è. Analysis Plan

### Step 1 ‚Äì Data Cleaning

* Select relevant columns only.
* Filter rows with `Violation` containing ‚ÄúSPEED‚Äù.
* Drop missing or invalid entries.
* Normalize brand names for consistency.

### Step 2 ‚Äì EDA

* Count speeding violations per brand.
* Calculate percentages of violations by price tier.
* Visualize with:

  * Bar charts (speeding counts per brand)
  * Boxplots (price tier vs speeding rate)
  * Heatmaps (correlations between features)

### Step 3 ‚Äì Hypothesis Testing

* **H‚ÇÄ:** No relationship between vehicle price tier and speeding frequency.
* **H‚ÇÅ:** Luxury brands have a higher proportion of speeding violations.
* Apply chi-square or ANOVA tests; compute effect size (Cram√©r‚Äôs V).

### Step 4 ‚Äì Machine Learning

* Build **classification models** (Logistic Regression / Random Forest).
* Predict `is_speeding` using features: price tier, brand, vehicle type, time of day.
* Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC.
* Interpret **feature importance**.

### Step 5 ‚Äì Visualization & Storytelling

* Create visuals in Matplotlib / Seaborn showing:

  * Speeding distribution by tier and brand.
  * Hour-of-day patterns for different price segments.
  * Predictive model feature importance.
* Summarize findings in a clear narrative.

## 8Ô∏è. Data Compatibility Justification

The traffic-violation data spans multiple years, while the car-price dataset provides a recent snapshot of brand-level prices in the U.S.
Because brand-price hierarchies remain stable over time, these data can be integrated reliably for behavioral analysis.
This ensures the enrichment variable (‚Äúprice tier‚Äù) accurately represents brand value rather than transient market conditions.

## Summary

**Main Dataset:** Traffic Violations (Maryland ‚Äì Data.gov)
**Enrichment Dataset:** US Sales Cars Dataset (Kaggle)
**Objective:** Determine whether higher-priced vehicle brands are more frequently involved in speeding violations.
**Outcome:** Apply data-science methods to test a social perception with real evidence.
